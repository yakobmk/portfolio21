                                <p class="lightfontlink">An entertainment label is usually concerned with the intersection between the talent (the artist) and the fans. Moreover, because radical route is an upcoming and  a young label, the site represented an initial communication between fans and upcoming artists. Hence, the layout and structuring needed to be clearly understood, options needed to be easy to find and browse through for the purposes of either exploring recent releases, looking through an artist’s page or look and purchase tickets for in person events should be categorized in an orderly manner.  </p>

Each path allowed users to explore releases, find events, go to the artist's page and learn about the details and behind the scenes of a released artwork.</p>

                                <p class="lightfontlink">Working closely with radical’s ecommerce team, we created several iterations of wireframes to refine the journey and ensure that all options available were fully compatible by the back-end ordering, minimize cluttering, personalizing experience to further create a connection between artist and fans, optimizing content display system and the production process at the atelier.

                        <p class="lightfontlink"> Users start by choosing a specific released project, and are then able to explore the project from a high level through pop up videos and/or images of the project. In addition, through a “view full project button” users are also allowed to explore details of the project including other non-released iterations of the product the artist was working though and also behind the scenes action of making that product itself.

                                <p class="lightfontlink">One of the main challenges was to ensure that each content (pictures and videos) were represented correctly while also maintaining page load times. We experimented on how to design the layout of our art page and discover page. Initially we tried to simply have a landscape view for our videos and have a portrait view for our pictures, but the results were not realistic enough to be a better use case for users since video content could be both landscape and portrait and vice versa with images. 
                                </p>
                            </section>

                    <!-- <p class="lightfontlink" >Putting the emphasis on the functionality to make it a straight forward and seamless call to action</p> -->

                    <section class="sectiondisplay">
                        <img class="introimage" src="./assets/radicalassetsecond.png" alt="">
                        <p class="lightfontlink">We then iterated more and incorporated the idea of art and its nature of both fluidity and rigidness into our content page layout. as a result we came up with four different sizes for both videos and pictures which came together in a fluid manner, which provided a much more aesthetically appealing result while at the same time tying together the concept of art with our content release display, which also served as a consistent theme in the brand identity of Radical Route’s digital presence.

                                <p class="lightfontlink">Another focus we had in creating this web app is to represent our talents. We wanted to create an artist page that would display a curated list of contents specifically from a selected artist, which also includes links to social media of artists.

                                <p class="lightfontlink">To create a better interactive platform, we sought to more than just present content to our fans online. We wanted to get the input of fans, and we also wanted to create an opportunity to create a bond offline between artist and fans. Hence, the event section of the web app needed focus. We tried to represent the feel of in person concerts or art galleries throughout our events page, where users are able to find upcoming events in which they can purchase tickets towards.</p>

                        <p class="lightfontlink">More importantly, we decided to have links that would serve as a pop up with an input and submittal link that users are able to enter what their interest is in creating the opportunity for an event place at a particular place. In the midst of our iteration we also decided to present a similar link that would allow radical route to receive potential requests of artists that would like to be represented by radical route, and or create an opportunity for a collaboration or a partnership to come about.
